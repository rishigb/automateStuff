#WHY I NEEDED THIS

I use a mac and I do a lot of photography too. One of the many problems I have faced is to remove images. The Shift +Del approach or any other keyboard command that I know of wasn't deleting it the way it did in the Linux distros I have used or the Windows.

So here is what I did, type the filenames in a csv format and give that as an input, the script removes those files. No hassle. If you know of a better way, please let me know. Thanks!
